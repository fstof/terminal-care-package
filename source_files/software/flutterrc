# Flutter environment vars and setup

### change this to your flutter install location. Since I'm using FVM this points to the default flutter version
export FLUTTER_HOME=$HOME/fvm/default
###

### more vars and PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$FLUTTER_HOME/bin: # flutter cli
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin # global pub
